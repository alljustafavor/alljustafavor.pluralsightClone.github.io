# Pluralsight-Login-Clone

This project is a clone of the Pluralsight login page using HTML and CSS. It demonstrates how to create a responsive and interactive web page that mimics the design and functionality of the original site. 

The project uses HTML elements such as forms, inputs, buttons, links, and icons to create the layout and structure of the page. It also uses CSS properties such as flexbox, grid, media queries, transitions, animations, and variables to style and position the elements.

The project is intended for educational purposes only and does not use any JavaScript or backend code.
